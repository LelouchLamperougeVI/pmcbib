abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane. 2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec. 3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells. 4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29{\%} of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two ofthe three parameters. Areduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57 {\%} of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43 {\%}, and of the population spike in 40 {\%}, of all experiments. 5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike ('frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation. 6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

abstract = {New memories are believed to be consolidated over several hours of post-task sleep. The reactivation or “replay” of hippocampal cell assemblies has been proposed to provide a key mechanism for this process. However, previous studies have indicated that such replay is restricted to the first 10–30 min of post-task sleep, suggesting that it has a limited role in memory consolidation. We performed long-duration recordings in sleeping and behaving male rats and applied methods for evaluating the reactivation of neurons in pairs as well as in larger ensembles while controlling for the continued activation of ensembles already present during pre-task sleep (“preplay”). We found that cell assemblies reactivate for up to 10 h, with a half-maximum timescale of ∼6 h, in sleep following novel experience, even when corrected for preplay. We further confirmed similarly prolonged reactivation in post-task sleep of rats in other datasets that used behavior in novel environments. In contrast, we saw limited reactivation in sleep following behavior in familiar environments. Overall, our findings reconcile the duration of replay with the timescale attributed to cellular memory consolidation and provide strong support for an integral role of replay in memory.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons that are active during an experience reactivate again afterward during rest and sleep. This replay of ensembles of neurons has been proposed to help strengthen memories, but it has also been reported that replay occurs only in the first 10–30 min of sleep, suggesting a circumscribed role. We performed long-duration recordings in the hippocampus of rats and found that replay persists for several hours in sleep following novel experience, far beyond the limits found in previous reports based on shorter recordings. These findings reconcile the duration of replay with the hours-long timescales attributed to memory consolidation.},

abstract = {How do external environmental and internal movement-related information combine to tell us where we are? We examined the neural representation of environmental location provided by hippocampal place cells while mice navigated a virtual reality environment in which both types of information could be manipulated. Extracellular recordings were made from region CA1 of head-fixed mice navigating a virtual linear track and running in a similar real environment. Despite the absence of vestibular motion signals, normal place cell firing and theta rhythmicity were found. Visual information alone was sufficient for localized firing in 25{\%} of place cells and to maintain a local field potential theta rhythm (but with significantly reduced power). Additional movement-related information was required for normally localized firing by the remaining 75{\%} of place cells. Trials in which movement and visual information were put into conflict showed that they combined nonlinearly to control firing location, and that the relative influence of movement versus visual information varied widely across place cells. However, within this heterogeneity, the behavior of fully half of the place cells conformed to a model of path integration in which the presence of visual cues at the start of each run together with subsequent movement-related updating of position was sufficient to maintain normal fields.},

@article{Muller1987,
abstract = {A TV/computer technique was used to simultaneously track a rat's position in a simple apparatus and record the firing of single hippocampal complex-spike neurons. The primary finding is that many of these neurons behave as "place cells," as first described by O'Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971) and O'Keefe (1976). Each place cell fires rapidly only when the rat is in a delimited portion of the apparatus (the cell's "firing field"). In agreement with O'Keefe (1976) and many other authors, we have seen that the firing of place cells is highly correlated with the animal's position and is remarkably independent of other aspects of the animal's behavioral state. Several properties of firing fields were characterized. Firing fields are stable over long time intervals (days) if the environment is constant. They come in several shapes when the animal is in a cylindrical apparatus; moreover, the set of field shapes is different when the animal is in a rectangular apparatus. It also seems that a single cell may have more than one field in a given apparatus. By collecting a sample of 40 place cells in a fixed environment, it has been possible to describe certain features of the place cell population, including the spatial distribution of fields within the apparatus, the average size of fields, and the "intensity" of fields (as measured by maximum firing rate). We also tested the hypothesis that the firing rate of each place cell signals the animal's distance from a point (the field center) so that a weighted average of the firing of the individual cells encodes the animal's position within the apparatus. The animal's position, calculated according to this "distance hypothesis," is systematically different from the animal's true position; this implies that the hypothesis in its simplest form is wrong.},

abstract = {Clustering is a concept used in a huge variety of applications. We review a conceptually very simple algorithm for hierarchical clustering called in the following the {\{}$\backslash$it mutual information clustering{\}} (MIC) algorithm. It uses mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure and exploits its grouping property: The MI between three objects X, Y, and Z is equal to the sum of the MI between X and Y, plus the MI between Z and the combined object (XY). We use MIC both in the Shannon (probabilistic) version of information theory, where the "objects" are probability distributions represented by random samples, and in the Kolmogorov (algorithmic) version, where the "objects" are symbol sequences. We apply our method to the construction of phylogenetic trees from mitochondrial DNA sequences and we reconstruct the fetal ECG from the output of independent components analysis (ICA) applied to the ECG of a pregnant woman.},

abstract = {In some neuronal networks in the brain which are thought to operate as associative memories, a sparse coding of information can enhance the storage capacity. The extent to which this statement is valid in general is discussed here, by considering some simple formal models of associative memory which include different neurobiological constraints. In nets of linear neurons, trained with either a Hebbian (purely incremental) or a Stanton and Sejnowski learning rule, sparse coding increases the number of independent associations that can be stored. When neurons are nonlinear, for a diversity of learning rules, sparse coding may result in an increase in the number of patterns that can be discriminated. The analysis is then used to help interpret recent evidence on the encoding of information in the taste and visual systems, as obtained from recordings in primates. Following the taste pathway, it is found that the breadth of tuning of individual neurons becomes progressively finer, consistent with the idea that sparser representations become advantageous as the taste information is eventually associated with that coming from other sensory modalities. In the visual system, considering a population of neurons in the temporal cortex that respond preferentially to faces, it is argued that their breadth of tuning represents a compromise between fully distributed encoding, and a grandmother cell type of encoding, which would result in a given neuron responding only to an individual face.},

abstract = {Memory consolidation is a gradual process through which episodic memories become incorporated into long-term 'semantic' representations. It likely involves reactivation of neural activity encoding the recent experience during non-REM sleep. A critical prerequisite for memory consolidation is precise coordination of reactivation events between the hippocampus and cortical/subcortical structures, facilitated by the coupling of local field potential (LFP) oscillations (slow oscillations, sleep spindles and sharp wave/ripples) between these structures. We review the rapidly expanding literature on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of hippocampal oscillatory and neuronal coupling with cortical/subcortical structures in the context of memory reactivation. Reactivation in the hippocampus and cortical/subcortical structures is tightly coupled with sharp wave/ripples. Hippocampal-cortical/subcortical coupling is rich in dimensionality and this dimensionality is likely underestimated due to the limitations of the current methodology.},
